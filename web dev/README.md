# Fitness-Website
Fitness website to be linked with a fitness app. Started as a school project.

Since this is hosted on GitHub, MySQL database is non-functional. 
This means the login, registration, and contact form do not work here but they are workable in IDE! 


#Features
*Modern, single-page parallax layout
*Working login and registration forms with validation
*Working contact form
*Dashboard with progress bars and leaderboard (non-functional)
*Completely responsive design using Bootstrap
